In November 2025, I traveled to Perth to present my PhD research. It was a major milestone for me, as I shared my explainable gene prioritization tool with a community of clinical experts. 

Beyond the conference, I had some unforgettable experiences exploring Western Australia:

* **Rottnest Island & Quokkas:** I took the ferry to Rottnest Island and spent the day cycling around the beautiful beaches. The highlight was definitely meeting the **quokkas**—they really are as friendly and photogenic as everyone says!
* **The Perth Mint:** I visited the historic Perth Mint, where I watched a traditional gold pour and learned about Australia’s gold-mining history. Seeing the world’s largest gold coin was incredible.
* **Kings Park:** I also spent some time taking in the views of the Swan River from the botanic gardens.

Perth was the perfect combination of professional growth and an amazing travel experience.
