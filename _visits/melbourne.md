*A view from the University of Melbourne with the iconic city skyline in the background.*

I moved to Melbourne in October 2024 to start my PhD journey, and it has quickly become one of my favorite places in the world. Being based at the **University of Melbourne** means I get to work in a world-class research environment right on the edge of a vibrant, busy city.

What I love about living here:

* **The University Vibe:** Spending my days at the Parkville campus and Melbourne Connect is inspiring. The photo above shows the perfect mix of the academic world and the beautiful Melbourne city line.
* **The Coffee & Culture:** Melbourne is famous for its coffee, and I’ve spent many afternoons exploring the little laneways and cafes around the city. 
* **City Life:** Whether it’s walking through the Royal Botanic Gardens or seeing the skyline light up at night, there is always something to see.

Living here while working on my research in AI and epilepsy has been an amazing experience. It’s a city that really values both innovation and a good quality of life.
