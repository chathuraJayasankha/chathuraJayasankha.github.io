I moved to Melbourne in October 2024 to start my PhD journey, and it has quickly become one of my favorite places in the world. Being based at the **University of Melbourne** means I get to work in a world-class research environment right on the edge of a vibrant, busy city.

What I love about living here:

* **The University Vibe:** Spending my days at the Parkville campus and Melbourne Connect is inspiring. The photo above shows the perfect mix of the academic world and the beautiful Melbourne city line.
* **Nature & Sunsets:** I really enjoy exploring the lush **green gardens and lawns** around the city. Whether it’s a walk through the Royal Botanic Gardens or catching a **colorful sunset** over the Melbourne city line, the natural beauty here is a great escape from the lab.
* **Student Life:** My evenings are often spent staying active—either playing **table tennis at Melbourne Connect** or spending time at the **UniMelb Gym**. It’s a great way to recharge and connect with the university community outside of research.
* **Food & Beaches:** I’ve spent many evenings enjoying the **flavourful restaurants at Lygon Street**, which is famous for its incredible food. On the weekends, I love heading out to the local **beaches** to enjoy the coastal views and fresh air.

Living here while working on my research in AI and epilepsy has been an amazing experience. It’s a city that really values both innovation and a good quality of life.
