*Exploring the Sydney Harbour during the 2024 December holidays.*

In December 2024, I took a trip to New South Wales for the summer holidays. After my first few months of PhD research in Melbourne, it was the perfect time to explore more of Australia.

The highlights of the trip included:

* **Sydney Icons:** Seeing the **Sydney Opera House** and the **Harbour Bridge** in person was amazing. The holiday atmosphere around Circular Quay and Darling Harbour was very lively.
* **Blue Mountains:** I spent time in the **Blue Mountains**, exploring the famous "Three Sisters" and the misty green hills. The air was so fresh, and the views from the lookout points were some of the best I've ever seen.
* **Newcastle:** I also traveled up to **Newcastle**, a beautiful coastal city. It has a much more relaxed vibe than Sydney, and I really enjoyed walking along the coast and seeing the historic architecture of the city.

This trip was a great mix of famous city landmarks and beautiful nature. It was exactly what I needed to refresh before heading back to the University of Melbourne for my 2025 research.
