*Competing in the Asian Physics Olympiad (APhO) in Yakutsk, Russia.*

Representing my country at the Asian Physics Olympiad in 2017 took me to Yakutsk, Russia. It was one of the coldest places I’ve ever been! The competition was very tough, but it was an unforgettable experience that tested my academic resilience and my ability to adapt to a totally different environment.
