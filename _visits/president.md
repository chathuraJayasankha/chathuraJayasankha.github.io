*Meeting President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo.*

In early 2017, I had the incredible honor of being invited to meet the **President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena**. This meeting was held to recognize the top achievers of the 2016 G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations.

Having ranked **2nd in the Island** out of more than 33,000 candidates in the Physical Science stream, this was a very special day for me. We visited the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, where the President spoke with us about our future goals and our contributions to the country.

It was a proud moment not just for me, but for my parents and my school, **Richmond College**. Seeing your hard work recognized at the highest level of the country is something I will never forget, and it gave me a lot of motivation as I started my engineering degree at the University of Moratuwa.
