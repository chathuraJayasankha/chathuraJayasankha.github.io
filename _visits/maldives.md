*Enjoying the crystal clear blue waters of the Maldives.*

Since the Maldives is so close to Sri Lanka, I took a trip there to experience what everyone calls "paradise." It really lived up to the name!

Highlights of the trip included:

* **Ziyaaraifushi:** Staying at **Ziyaaraifushi** was incredible. The island is surrounded by endless blue water that is so clear you can see the fish right from the shore.
* **Amazing Boat Rides:** We spent a lot of time on boats, traveling between islands and looking for dolphins. The feeling of the ocean breeze and the bright sun was the best part of the trip.
* **The Perfect Getaway:** Because it’s such a short flight from home, it was the perfect way to relax and recharge. There’s nothing quite like the white sand and peaceful vibes of the Maldivian islands.
