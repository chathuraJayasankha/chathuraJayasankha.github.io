**Abstract:**
Identifying genes responsible for complex genetic disorders remains a significant challenge due to the complex nature of polygenic diseases and the demand for a large number of experiments. This study aims to uncover novel disease-gene relationships by integrating multi-modal biological data, such as gene expression, protein-level interactions, and knowledge gathered from research articles through machine learning. 

First, we use Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE) as a case study, and further extend it to other neurological disorders to evaluate generalizability. The project aims to establish a scalable framework for identifying novel disease-gene relationships and guiding and accelerating experimental validation.
