*Presenting our work on explainable AI for gene prioritization at the 39th ESA Annual Scientific Meeting.*

I presented our group's work on explainable gene prioritization tools. This three-day meeting (Nov 5-7) focused on bridging the gap between world-class science and clinical outcomes. I received valuable feedback from clinicians on how our AI models can better support clinical decision-making.
